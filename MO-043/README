E. Assigned high z-index to UI elements (extension.css)<-See ISSUES[3]
--------
ISSUES - HOST ACCOUNT CLOSED (Simulating UI/UX features w/screenshot) 
1. widgets get lost on Twitter scroll (also on page reload?)
2. cross-tab messaging for persistent Config State of UI 
    Lesson/Unit content, 
    last DIVs open, 
    localStorage chrome.storage “content scripts can directly access 
    user data without the need for a background page”
3. Optimization
    request (.load) modal content on launch of extension?
    When to cache?
4. extension. sprite image files not loading (for close button): 
    "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 
    404 (Not Found)"
Referring to files bg images info at developer.chrome.com 
5. Updating Mentor Status and Notifications data - many user actions can 
    prompt a server request for updates; but, does this increase bandwidth 
    substantially, unnecessarily?
6. Tracking the User
    User time on task -
    Does a student’s performance on an end-of-Unit vocab quiz correlate 
        to their total time in “session”?
    Can we display for the teacher the average time per link, per lesson, 
        spent by each user?
    Store data in client pending exit, other major event to minimize 
        server requests? 
7. Monitoring the System - observe the time needed for a behaviour 
    to occur; for example:
        Average Response time to HTTP Requests
